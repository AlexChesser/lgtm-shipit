# Interview Preparation

This podcast is a work-in-progress early interviews are going to be the place where we learn precisely what makes a good interview. Some considerations if you're coming along for an interview.

In all cases, these are suggestions only. If any of this is overwhelming or uninteresting to you, you can go audio only. Podcasting is an audio medium and the youtube bit is an add-on. 

## An Important Reminder

An interview is a publicly facing conversation. Anything you might say that wouldn't be accessible to a total stranger should be left out.  Anything that directly names or criticises a non-public individual will get cut, but shouldn't be said either way.  If there are valuable insights, take the time to anonymize your stories.

## Consider your audio quality

> High quality audio makes you sound smarter
> People rated a physicist’s talk as 19.3% better when they listened to it in high (vs low) audio quality. **They also thought he was smarter and liked him more.**

In the interests of making sure you "present" in the best light you possibly can, consider upgrading your microphone if you haven't already. The bonus effect being that if you're remote, your colleagues at work may also like you more as well! 

## Remote interviews

* Zoom meetings allows unlimited 1:1 on the free tier and it is by far one of the best technologies on the market for video conferencing. If you have the desktop version of zoom installed, great, otherwise as long as you have a browser you should be able to get in for the chat.
* Consider your comfort in the setting. Do you think you'll be able to last for an hour or two? Will you be able to relax and really think about things? Will there be any [interruptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY)?
* Consider the background audio of your setting, is there construction? Barking dogs? Delighted and happy children sqealing with joy?
* Consider your lighting before the interview. 
  * try placing a bright light behind your screen. This will *bounce* light off the wall behind it, but the light itself won't be shining painfully into your eyes. The camera *loves* this.
    * it will give your face a lovely fill
    * your camera won't have to work as hard, so your pircture will be much higher quality.
  * Consider the lights behind you. Cameras adjust the amount of light the allow in based on the average amount of light coming in across all pixels in the entire image. If the sun is behind you your camera will automatically seem to darken your (again, lovely) face and we won't be able to see you.
* Consider the overall quality of the image if you are using a zoom background.
  * is there a noticable difference in brightness between the background and the rest of you?
  * do parts of the background materialize and disappear as you move your head? Do your hands or face disappear when you move them?
  * If the zoom background isn't working well *consider* turning it off, going audio only, or going "ALL IN" and setting up a [snap cam](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/).
  * UPDATE: the new zoom BLUR background is actually really great and does a very good job of solving for almost all the most egregious issues with respect to background pop in, sharp cuts around your hair, differnetial lighting between background and you. If you'd like to use a zoom background this absoloutely looks the best in terms of overall image quality.
    * this feature requires zoom 5.5.0 or greater
    * to update zoom, click your profile picture while not in a meeting and select "Check for Updates"

## On getting the questions ahead of time

The guides I've read on how to be a good interviewer say that I should not provide questions ahead of time. I *have* written around 30 potential questions that I hope are open ended enough that they will elicit interesting responses.

I feel that it would probably be some pretty serious hubris and arrogance if I ignored the advice of experts before I've conducted a single intervew, but the technologist in me wants to A/B test  the theory. Does it really make for a better interview if you don't know what's coming? 

I actually think there's other variables in play, but, if I post a list of questions in this repo, then I can't really put the genie back into the bottle.

If you are willing to "trust the process" as recommended by experts, we'll go with blind questions. In all cases, this interview is about you and if knowing what you're going to be asked ahead of time helps you feel more comfortable, I will by all means send you a link to the google sheet where they're all written down.

> **In all cases, this interview is about you**

As the interviews have progressed I've found that knowing the way things are going to go can make for more interesting content.

As an overview of what you can expect.

I like to start with asking what your first memory of technology is.  Then we talk about how you moved from early interest to basic education (school, university) and what you learned along the way.

From there I like to ask about how you made the transition from school to your first professional gig... discuss the major things that you learned at the stage,  Then we rinse and repeat for your story in terms of getting through to where you are now. 

At any point if there is anything that you feel is particularly interesting or worth bringing up, let me know and we'll follow all your interesting tangents and story lines. 

Finally "is there anything I've missed?" where you can tell me anything about what you're really passionate about.

You shouldn't have to prepare too much, because it really is just about your story, but if that helps you prepare and come to the table with some of your better stories then that's great!
