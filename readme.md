## Interview Preparation

This podcast is a work-in-progress early interviews are going to be the place where we learn precisely what makes a good interview. Some considerations if you're coming along for an interview.

In all cases, these are suggestions only. If any of this is overwhelming or uninteresting to you, you can go audio only. Podcasting is an audio medium and the youtube bit is an add-on. 

**Remote interviews**
* Zoom meetings allows unlimited 1:1 on the free tier and it is by far one of the best technologies on the market for video conferencing. If you have the desktop version of zoom installed, great, otherwise as long as you have a browser you should be able to get in for the chat.
* Consider your comfort in the setting. Do you think you'll be able to last for an hour or two? Will you be able to relax and really think about things? Will there be any [interruptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY)?
* Consider the background audio of your setting, is there construction? Barking dogs? Delighted and happy children sqealing with joy?
* Consider your lighting before the interview. 
  * try placing a bright light behind your screen. This will *bounce* light off the wall behind it, but the light itself won't be shining painfully into your eyes. The camera *loves* this.
    * it will give your face a lovely fill
    * your camera won't have to work as hard, so your pircture will be much higher quality.
  * Consider the lights behind you. Cameras adjust the amount of light the allow in based on the average amount of light coming in across all pixels in the entire image. If the sun is behind you your camera will automatically seem to darken your (again, lovely) face and we won't be able to see you.
* Consider the overall quality of the image if you are using a zoom background.
  * is there a noticable difference in brightness between the background and the rest of you?
  * do parts of the background materialize and disappear as you move your head? Do your hands or face disappear when you move them?
  * If the zoom background isn't working well *consider* turning it off, going audio only, or going "ALL IN" and setting up a [snap cam](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/).

### On getting the questions ahead of time:

The guides I've read on how to be a good interviewer say that I should not provide questions ahead of time. I *have* written around 30 potential questions that I hope are open ended enough that they will elicit interesting responses.

I feel that it would probably be some pretty serious hubris and arrogance if I ignored the advice of experts before I've conducted a single intervew, but the technologist in me wants to A/B test  the theory. Does it really make for a better interview if you don't know what's coming? 

I actually think there's other variables in play, but, if I post a list of questions in this repo, then I can't really put the genie back into the bottle.

If you are willing to "trust the process" as recommended by experts, we'll go with blind questions. In all cases, this interview is about you and if knowing what you're going to be asked ahead of time helps you feel more comfortable, I will by all means send you a link to the google sheet where they're all written down.

> **In all cases, this interview is about you**

The nice part about whichever way you decide to go, will be that we will be able to get a more robust idea of whether knowing the questions that will be on the test produces better results.

Of course, there is always the chance of spontaneous questions based on what you say. This isn't about reading through a script, it is about having a conversation and hearing your story.

## Interview Nominations

As the podcast progresses, I will inevitably run out of my own personal network of developers to interview. I'm hoping to start gathering community input right away. If you know a developer who you think would make a great interview candidate **OR** if you are a community member who thinks you would be willing to tell me about yourself, please open a new issue with the label "interview-proposal".

In the interview proposal, please take a moment to say something nice about them. What makes you admire them? What makes you think they'd be an interesting subject? If you have a *public* method of contacting them, please post. Do not post private contact information.

There aren't any hard rules about who constitutes interesting but in the first round, I want to focus on developers with 10+ years experience, those who've shown exceptional leadership and, developers from traditionally under-represented demographics and diverse backgrounds.

People with perspectives! People with stories.
