## Interview Nominations

As the podcast progresses, I will inevitably run out of my own personal network of developers to interview. I'm hoping to start gathering community input right away. If you know a developer who you think would make a great interview candidate **OR** if you are a community member who thinks you would be willing to tell me about yourself, please open a new issue with the label "interview-proposal".

In the interview proposal, please take a moment to say something nice about them. What makes you admire them? What makes you think they'd be an interesting subject? If you have a *public* method of contacting them, please post. Do not post private contact information.

There aren't any hard rules about who constitutes interesting but in the first round, I want to focus on developers with 10+ years experience, those who've shown exceptional leadership and, developers from traditionally under-represented demographics and diverse backgrounds.

People with perspectives! People with stories.
