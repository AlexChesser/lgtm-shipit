## Episodes

### [Episode 0 - Shipit](Episodes/Episode0.md)

I did not initially intend to share this video. It was initially a workflow and camera test to make sure I had the production process working. Lighting, framing, audio, set dressing, script, delivery, there are a *LOT* of variables in producing a single video.

I spent hours and came up with something that despite my efforts managed to put the "M" in MVP! I was planning on showing it to a few of my early interviewees to gater feedback, but the next day I came across [this comment on hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26533837) which resonated with what I'd been feeling and had *just last night* had posted a video on.

Within a few hours I gained about a hundred subscribers in youtube, a few dozen comments saying things like "good work" and "I'm looking forward to your next episode". Friends and strangers were giving me great advice and action items to improve the quality for the next one.

One user had the generosity to comment on some of the issues I've opened for keeping track of all the things that need to be done.

It's been so energising, empowering and, validating that there might just be a viable product here. It redoubled my resolve to push forward "at least one more episode" and fills me with a very heady mix of pride and obligation.

Friends and strangers took the time to speak up and say kind things. I am so greatful to them. I cannot wait to prove worthy of that participation.

### Episode 1 - Ky Patterson - Technical Architect @ Klick Health

Ky Patterson was charitable enough to be my first interview. We discuss issues like the right time and place to use fancy frameworks (like REACT) and when we should go with static sites. We also talk about how to avoid code entropy when working with long-lived projects. It was uploaded in 2 parts and the "cut" at the end of part one is really jarring.  

Sorry, I'll do better on that one in future.

## Upcoming Episodes - things to look forward to

### Episode 2 - Arthur Lorena - Full Stack Developer @ Klick Health

The interview with Arthur Lorena has been recorded and IMO went really well! We talk about a bunch of really fun and interesting topics. From his early start in technology in Brasil as the son of a COBOL programmer to his thoughts on what it means to be a 10x engineer. I really enjoyed this chat and can't wait to share it.

## Interview Nominations

As the podcast progresses, I will inevitably run out of my own personal network of developers to interview. I'm hoping to start gathering community input right away. If you know a developer who you think would make a great interview candidate **OR** if you are a community member who thinks you would be willing to tell me about yourself, please open a new issue with the label "interview-proposal".

In the interview proposal, please take a moment to say something nice about them. What makes you admire them? What makes you think they'd be an interesting subject? If you have a *public* method of contacting them, please post. Do not post private contact information.

There aren't any hard rules about who constitutes interesting but in the first round, I want to focus on developers with 10+ years experience, those who've shown exceptional leadership and, developers from traditionally under-represented demographics and diverse backgrounds.

People with perspectives! People with stories.
