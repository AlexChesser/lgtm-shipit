# LGTM: Shipit - Episode Zero

## About the episode

I was talking to a coworker about tech. How do we make our current situation better? What cool things can we do that will improve our current situation? If you're reading this, you know the kind of discussion. A pair of hackers talking about all the big ideas they could do, the "ideal end state" and starting to break down practical steps we could take to get there.

A few ideas popped into my head:

* good God, do I miss these discussions
* I really wish I could go ask some of my mentors what they would do here
* I could get better if I asked smart people for advice
* I should call them and learn from them
* I should record and share the insights from those calls...

Now, if you know that feeling of creative free association you know the way there are a thousand other ideas at the same time, but there it was. The idea for the podcast was born.

I said to my colleague I'd like to do a podcast of interviews with great technologists that I've learned from. In typical excited and supportive technologist fashion, he gave me an "oh hell yes" 

If you've been reading hacker news for long enough you know that we call this "my first customer." I should further test this theory... 

I decided to see if I could get 10 more people who thought it was a good idea and who'd be willing to "pay me" to do it. The paymet I am willing to accept is a couple hours of their time. Let's put this in perspective though, these are generally high income people with very demanding jobs and families. The in-kind value of their time would cost WAAAAYYY more than the $0 they'll be getting.  Reasonably speaking two hours of a top tier programmer's time is *easily* worth $500.

I sent this message to a large number of the close connections I have on linkedin. 

> Hey [old friend's name], I'm thinking of starting a podcast where I interview the great programmers I've worked with in my career. Nothing firm yet, but would you be willing to give 1 to 2 hours for me to interview you about your career and philosophies on technology, work and business? I'm trying to find 10 people who'd be willing to be interviewed before I start.

In the four hours it took between sending out my initial query I'd heard yes 10 more times, 1 decline (which evolved into a "maybe if drunk and anonymous" as the discussion progressed) and didn't hear "no" once. 

This was exciting.

But also ... oh shit ... now I'm on the hook. Let's run the numbers again. If we're looking at the dollar value of hiring these experts as freelancers, my friends, within the span of about 4 hours effectively told me they'd be willing to pay me a *lowball* estimate of $5k worth of their time to do this job.  

I'd better do a damned good job here.

I was looking for validation that the idea was viable on its surface. From the perspective of "can I create the product?" perspective. On average, it looks like people are willing to tell their stories.

Though I acknowledge, these are people that I've had a personal connection with in the past. Positive response rate will undountedly fall when the time comes to start cold approaching strangers.  

If my friends are going to *give me* that value, I would love to find ways to provide 10X that value back to them. I want that time they give me to serve as an investment where we all win (including you, dear reader).

Again, I've got to do a really good job to pay for the value of the gift of time that my friends are giving me. This first episode was created as a camera test. Quality is critical in providing value.

## Episode script

In the coming weeks I’m going to be interviewing professional programmers about their experiences in the industry, thoughts on technology, and how they became the leaders that they are.

I hope that together we can all grow and improve in our craft. I would like to spark productive and respectful discussion about how we solve big problems.

I’m going to be talking with the people whose work I admire. I’ll be asking them about the spark that drives them and how they look at problems. I’d like to hear stories about the craziest bugs they’ve met, the biggest wins or, just the stories of the projects they’ve worked on, applications they’ve built and their impact on the world around them.

How do you lead teams in the development of software? How do you mentor, encourage and grow developers in the early stages of their careers? How do you protect your projects against the inevitable small mistakes they make or the huge ones you do?

How do you decide which technologies to choose for a given job? Why are there so many Javascript frameworks?

[pause for laughter … it’s a podcast, nobody’s laughing. Note: do not read the stage direction]

It’s a definitional property of professionalism that we engage in continuous and deliberate self reflection on our performance. That we continually strive to improve our practice. That we never stop learning and growing in our role.

I hope that in having and sharing these discussions, we can all learn from each other and grow as individuals and as community.

While the discussions will be allowed to go where they lead, I do hope that as an interviewer I’m able to guide these conversations towards developing valuable insights into the business and craft of professional software development.

I also hope to raise the profiles of not just programmers in general, but programming as a craft and vocation. I want to find some way to convey the true majesty and power of software and celebrate the people who create it.

Think about this for a second. Bill Gates, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Larry Ellison, all programmers. Where would Elon Musk or Jack Ma be without programmers? Look at the biggest companies in the world right now, where would they be without programmers?

What sector doesn’t rely on software? What business isn’t aware that a software might come along and revolutionize their industry?

If software is the engine that our economy runs on, I’d like to talk to the people behind it.

Over the coming weeks I’ll be pre-recording and editing a number of interviews. When I have enough content recorded, I’m hoping to be able to maintain a weekly delivery schedule. As this is my first podcast, I would love your feedback. Please feel free to leave a comment or get in touch.

I would be deeply honored if you’d join me for these stories, if they sound like they’d be of interest to you, I’d appreciate it if you’d subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. Leave a comment to let me know what you think and maybe share it with a friend.
