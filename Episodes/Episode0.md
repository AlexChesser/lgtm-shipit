# LGTM: Shipit - Episode Zero

## About the episode

I was talking to a coworker about tech. How do we make our current situation better? What cool things can we do that will improve our current situation? If you're reading this, you know the kind of discussion. A pair of hackers talking about all the big ideas they could do, the "ideal end state" and starting to break down practical steps we could take to get there.

A few ideas popped into my head:

* good God, do I miss these discussions
* I really wish I could go ask some of my mentors what they would do here
* I could get better if I asked smart people for advice
* I should call them and learn from them
* I should record and share the insights from those calls...

Now, if you know that feeling of creative free association you know the way there are a thousand other ideas at the same time, but there it was. The idea for the podcast was born.

I said to my colleague I'd like to do a podcast of interviews with great technologists that I've learned from. In typical excited and supportive technologist fashion, he gave me an "oh hell yes" 

If you've been reading hacker news for long enough you know that we call this "my first customer." I should further test this theory... 

I decided to see if I could get 10 more people who thought it was a good idea and who'd be willing to "pay me" to do it. The paymet I am willing to accept is a couple hours of their time. Let's put this in perspective though, these are generally high income people with very demanding jobs and families. The in-kind value of their time would cost WAAAAYYY more than the $0 they'll be getting.  Reasonably speaking two hours of a top tier programmer's time is *easily* worth $500.

I sent this message to a large number of the close connections I have on linkedin. 

> Hey [old friend's name], I'm thinking of starting a podcast where I interview the great programmers I've worked with in my career. Nothing firm yet, but would you be willing to give 1 to 2 hours for me to interview you about your career and philosophies on technology, work and business? I'm trying to find 10 people who'd be willing to be interviewed before I start.

In the four hours it took between sending out my initial query I'd heard yes 10 more times, 1 decline (which evolved into a "maybe if drunk and anonymous" as the discussion progressed) and didn't hear "no" once. 

This was exciting.

But also ... oh shit ... now I'm on the hook. Let's run the numbers again. If we're looking at the dollar value of hiring these experts as freelancers, my friends, within the span of about 4 hours effectively told me they'd be willing to pay me a *lowball* estimate of $5k worth of their time to do this job.  

I'd better do a damned good job here.

I was looking for validation that the idea was viable on its surface. From the perspective of "can I create the product?" perspective. On average, it looks like people are willing to tell their stories.

Though I acknowledge, these are people that I've had a personal connection with in the past. Positive response rate will undountedly fall when the time comes to start cold approaching strangers.  

If my friends are going to *give me* that value, I would love to find ways to provide 10X that value back to them. I want that time they give me to serve as an investment where we all win (including you, dear reader).

Again, I've got to do a really good job to pay for the value of the gift of time that my friends are giving me. This first episode was created as a camera test. Quality is critical in providing value.
